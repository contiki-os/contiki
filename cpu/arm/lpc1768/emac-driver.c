/*
 * This is an example of how to write a network device driver ("packet
 * service") for Contiki. A packet service is a regular Contiki
 * service that does two things:
 * # Checks for incoming packets and delivers those to the TCP/IP stack
 * # Provides an output function that transmits packets
 *
 * The output function is registered with the Contiki service
 * mechanism, whereas incoming packets must be checked inside a
 * Contiki process. We use the same process for checking for incoming
 * packets and for registering the service.
 *
 * NOTE: This example does not work with the uip-fw module (packet
 * forwarding with multiple interfaces). It only works with a single
 * interface.
