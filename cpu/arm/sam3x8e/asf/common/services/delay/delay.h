 * The \ref F_CPU configuration constant is used for compatibility with the
 * \ref group_common_services_delay routines. The common loop-based delay
 * routines are designed to use the \ref clk_group modules while anticipating
 * support for legacy applications assuming a statically defined clock
 * frequency. Applications using a statically configured MCU clock frequency
 * can define \ref F_CPU (Hertz), in which case the common delay routines will
 * use this value rather than calling sysclk_get_cpu_hz() to get the current
 * MCU clock frequency.
