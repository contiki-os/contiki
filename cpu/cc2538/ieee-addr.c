     * By default, we assume that the IEEE address is stored on flash using
     * little-endian byte order.
     *
     * However, some SoCs ship with a different byte order, whereby the first
     * four bytes are flipped with the four last ones.
     *
     *     Using this address as an example: 00 12 4B 00 01 02 03 04
     *               We expect it stored as: 04 03 02 01 00 4B 12 00
     * But it is also possible to encounter: 00 4B 12 00 04 03 02 01
     *
     * Thus: read locations [3, 2, 1] and if we encounter the TI OUI, flip the
     * order of the two 4-byte sequences. Each of the 4-byte sequences is still
     * little-endian.
