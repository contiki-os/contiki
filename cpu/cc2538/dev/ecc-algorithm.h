 * This is a implementation of ECDH, ECDSA sign and ECDSA verify. It
 * uses ecc-driver to communicate with the PKA. It uses continuations
 * to free the main CPU / thread while the PKA is calculating.
 *
 * \note
 * Only one request can be processed at a time.
 * Maximal supported key length is 384bit (12 words).
