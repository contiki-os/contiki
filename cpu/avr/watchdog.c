/* Watchdog routines for the AVR */

/* The default timeout of 2 seconds works on most MCUs.
 * It should be disabled during sleep (unless used for wakeup) since
 * it draws significant current (~5 uamp on 1284p, 20x the MCU consumption).
 *
 * Note the wdt is not properly simulated in AVR Studio 4 Simulator 1:
 *   On many devices calls to wdt_reset will have no effect, and a wdt reboot will occur.
 *   The MCUSR will not show the cause of a wdt reboot.
 *   A 1MHz clock is assumed; at 8MHz timeout occurs 8x faster than it should.
 * Simulator 2 is supposed to work on supported devices (not atmega128rfa1),
 * but neither it nor Studio 5 beta do any resets on the 1284p.
 *
 * Setting WATCHDOG_CONF_TIMEOUT -1 will disable the WDT.
