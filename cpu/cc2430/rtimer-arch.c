/**
 * \file
 *         Hardware-dependent functions used to support the
 *         contiki rtimer module.
 *
 *         clock and etimer are using the sleep timer on the cc2430
 *
 *         clock_init() has set our tick speed prescaler already, so we
 *         are ticking with 500 kHz freq.
 *
 *         rtimer_clock_t is unsigned short (16bit on the cc2430)
 *         It thus makes sense to use the 16bit clock (Timer 1)
 *
 *         This file contains an ISR and must reside in the HOME bank
