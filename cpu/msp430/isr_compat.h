/* Cross compiler interrupt service routine compatibility definitions */
/* This code currently allows for:
        MSPGCC - the GNU tools for the MSP430
        Quadravox AQ430
        IAR Version 1 (old syntax)
        IAR Versions 2, 3, 4, 5 (new syntax)
        Rowley Crossworks
        Code Composer Essentials

   These macros allow us to define interrupt routines for all
   compilers with a common syntax:

    ISR(<interrupt>, <routine name>)
    {
    }

   e.g.

    ISR(ADC12, adc_service_routine)
    {
        ADC12CTL0 &= ~ENC;
        ADC12CTL0 |= ENC;
    }
