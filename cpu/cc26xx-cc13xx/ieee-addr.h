 *
 * Driver for the retrieval of an IEEE address from flash
 *
 * The user can specify a hardcoded IEEE address through the
 * IEEE_ADDR_CONF_HARDCODED configuration macro.
 *
 * If the user does not hard-code an address, then one will be read from either
 * the primary location (InfoPage) or from the secondary location (on flash).
 *
 * In order to allow the user to easily program nodes with addresses, the
 * secondary location is given priority: If it contains a valid address then
 * it will be chosen in favour of the one on InfoPage.
 *
 * In this context, an address is valid if at least one of the 8 bytes does not
 * equal 0xFF. If all 8 bytes are 0xFF, then the primary location will be used.
 *
 * In all cases, the address is assumed to be written little-endian.
 *
 * Lastly, it is possible to override the 2 LSB's of the address by using the
 * NODE_ID make variable.
