 *
 * The Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) sensor as well as the
 * Total Solar Radiation (TSR) sensor uses the 2.5V reference voltage
 * to produce the raw ADC value.

 * The voltage across each sensor is:
 *
 * VsensorPAR = ADCValuePAR/4096 * Vref       (1a)
 * VsensorTSR = ADCValueTSR/4096 * Vref       (1b)
 * where Vref = 2.5V
 *
 * This voltage creates a current through a resistor R=100KOhm and this
 * current has a linear relationship with the light intensity in Lux.
 * IPAR = VsensorPAR / 100,000             (2a) 
 * ITSR = VsensorTSR / 100,000             (2b) 
 *
 * S1087    (PAR) lx = 1e6 * IPAR * 1000   (3a)  
 * S1087-01 (TSR) lx = 1e5 * ITSR * 1000   (3b)
 *
 * lxPAR = 10e9 * ADCValuePAR *(1/4096)* Vref * 10e-5  or
 * lxPAR = 3125* ADCvaluePAR / 512  
 * and 
 * lxTSR = 10e8 * ADCValueTSR *(1/4096)* Vref * 10e-5  or
 * lxTSR = 625* ADCvalueTSR / 1024
