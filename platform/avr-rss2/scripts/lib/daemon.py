      # Is ignoring SIGHUP necessary?
      #
      # It's often suggested that the SIGHUP signal should be ignored before
      # the second fork to avoid premature termination of the process.  The
      # reason is that when the first child terminates, all processes, e.g.
      # the second child, in the orphaned group will be sent a SIGHUP.
      #
      # "However, as part of the session management system, there are exactly
      # two cases where SIGHUP is sent on the death of a process:
      #
      #   1) When the process that dies is the session leader of a session that
      #      is attached to a terminal device, SIGHUP is sent to all processes
      #      in the foreground process group of that terminal device.
      #   2) When the death of a process causes a process group to become
      #      orphaned, and one or more processes in the orphaned group are
      #      stopped, then SIGHUP and SIGCONT are sent to all members of the
      #      orphaned group." [2]
      #
      # The first case can be ignored since the child is guaranteed not to have
      # a controlling terminal.  The second case isn't so easy to dismiss.
      # The process group is orphaned when the first child terminates and
      # POSIX.1 requires that every STOPPED process in an orphaned process
      # group be sent a SIGHUP signal followed by a SIGCONT signal.  Since the
      # second child is not STOPPED though, we can safely forego ignoring the
      # SIGHUP signal.  In any case, there are no ill-effects if it is ignored.

         # a session leader without a controlling terminal, it's possible for
         # it to acquire one by opening a terminal in the future (System V-
         # based systems).  This second fork guarantees that the child is no
