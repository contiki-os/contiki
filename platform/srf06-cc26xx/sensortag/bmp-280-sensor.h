 *
 * Due to the time required for the sensor to startup, this driver is meant to
 * be used in an asynchronous fashion. The caller must first activate the
 * sensor by calling SENSORS_ACTIVATE(). This will trigger the sensor's startup
 * sequence, but the call will not wait for it to complete so that the CPU can
 * perform other tasks or drop to a low power mode.
 *
 * Once the sensor is stable, the driver will generate a sensors_changed event.
 *
 * We take readings in "Forced" mode. In this mode, the BMP will take a single
 * measurement and it will then automatically go to sleep.
 *
 * SENSORS_ACTIVATE must be called again to trigger a new reading cycle
