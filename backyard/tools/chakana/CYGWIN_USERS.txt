If you're on Cygwin and run into the 'sem_init: Resource temporarily unavailable' problem:

Current Cygwin python versions have problems with running out of PIDs, it is a known problem and there has been several discussions and bugreports related to it.
As of today, the best solution seems to be to rebase the Cygwin libraries:
	0> Make sure you have the rebaseall program, it can be downloaded using Cygwin's setup.exe

	1> Shut down all Cygwin processes and services (including shells)
	2> Start a regular Win command prompt ('cmd')
	3> Start 'ash'
	4> Start '/bin/rebaseall', expect this step to take some time..
	5> All done! This worked for me.
