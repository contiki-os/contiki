Contiki implementation for Plantower PMS 5003 series
dust sensors.

The PMS sensors support serial communication through UART and
I2C. This implementation supports both modes, and they can be
individually turned on/off through config options. Both can be
enabled at the same time.

In UART mode, the operation is asynchronous; the sensor periodically
outputs a frame of data, which is assembled by the sensor driver
through a UART callback function.

In I2C mode, the I2C bus is probed and if the sensor is found,
the frame is read. This is synchronous, triggered by a configurable
timer.

The sensor is duty-cycled through the SET input signal. The duty-cycling
intervals are configurable.

This implementation has been tested against the PMS 5003i (I2C) and
PMS 3003 (UART) sensors.
