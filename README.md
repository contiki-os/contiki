WARNING: this is my (K. Roussel) personal fork of the contiki OS,
where  I work on my PhD-related code.
The official Contiki repository is at: 
https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki

I hope that the work done in this fork will be one day integrated
into the official Contiki stream, which would allow this fork to
be deleted...

The Contiki Operating System
============================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/contiki-os/contiki.png)](http://travis-ci.org/contiki-os/contiki)

Contiki is an open source operating system that runs on tiny low-power
microcontrollers and makes it possible to develop applications that
make efficient use of the hardware while providing standardized
low-power wireless communication for a range of hardware platforms.

Contiki is used in numerous commercial and non-commercial systems,
such as city sound monitoring, street lights, networked electrical
power meters, industrial monitoring, radiation monitoring,
construction site monitoring, alarm systems, remote house monitoring,
and so on.
