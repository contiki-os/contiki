/**
 * Each radio has a set of parameters that designate the current
 * configuration and state of the radio. Parameters can either have
 * values of type radio_value_t, or, when this type is insufficient, a
 * generic object that is specified by a memory pointer and the size
 * of the object.
 *
 * The radio_value_t type is set to an integer type that can hold most
 * values used to configure the radio, and is therefore the most
 * common type used for a parameter. Certain parameters require
 * objects of a considerably larger size than radio_value_t, however,
 * and in these cases the documentation below for the parameter will
 * indicate this.
 *
 * All radio parameters that can vary during runtime are prefixed by
 * "RADIO_PARAM", whereas those "parameters" that are guaranteed to
 * remain immutable are prefixed by "RADIO_CONST". Each mutable
 * parameter has a set of valid parameter values. When attempting to
 * set a parameter to an invalid value, the radio will return
 * RADIO_RESULT_INVALID_VALUE.
 *
 * Some radios support only a subset of the defined radio parameters.
 * When trying to set or get such an unsupported parameter, the radio
 * will return RADIO_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED.
