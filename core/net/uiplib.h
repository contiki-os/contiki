/**
 * Convert a textual representation of an IP address to a numerical representation.
 *
 * This function takes a textual representation of an IP address in
 * the form a.b.c.d for IPv4 or a:b:c:d:e:f:g:h for IPv6 and converts
 * it into a numeric IP address representation that can be used by
 * other uIP functions.
 *
 * \param addrstr A pointer to a string containing the IP address in
 * textual form.
 *
 * \param addr A pointer to a uip_ip4addr_t that will be filled in with
 * the numerical representation of the address.
 *
 * \retval 0 If the IP address could not be parsed.
 * \retval Non-zero If the IP address was parsed.
