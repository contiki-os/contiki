 * @{
 *
 * The netflood module does best-effort flooding.
 *
 * The netflood primitive sends a single packet to all nodes in the
 * network. The netflood primitive uses polite broadcasts at every hop
 * to reduce the number of redundant transmissions.  The netflood
 * primitive does not perform retransmissions of flooded packets and
 * packets are not tagged with version numbers.  Instead, the netflood
 * primitive sets the end-to-end sender and end-to-end packet ID
 * attributes on the packets it sends.  A forwarding node saves the
 * end-to-end sender and packet ID of the last packet it forwards and
 * does not forward a packet if it has the same end-to-end sender and
 * packet ID as the last packet.  This reduces the risk of routing
 * loops, but does not eliminate them entirely as the netflood
 * primitive saves the attributes of the latest packet seen only.
 * Therefore, the netflood primitive also uses the time to live
 * attribute, which is decreased by one before forwarding a packet.
 * If the time to live reaches zero, the primitive does not forward
 * the packet.
 *
 * \section channels Channels
 *
 * The netflood module uses 1 channel.
