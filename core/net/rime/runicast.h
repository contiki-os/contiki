/**
 * \defgroup rimerunicast Single-hop reliable unicast
 * @{
 *
 * The reliable single-hop unicast primitive (runicast) reliably sends
 * a packet to a single-hop neighbor.  The runicast primitive uses
 * acknowledgements and retransmissions to ensure that the neighbor
 * successfully receives the packet.  When the receiver has
 * acknowledged the packet, the ruc module notifies the sending
 * application via a callback.  The ruc primitive uses the stubborn
 * single-hop unicast primitive to do retransmissions.  Thus, the ruc
 * primitive does not have to manage the details of setting up timers
 * and doing retransmissions, but can concentrate on dealing with
 * acknowledgements.
 *
 * The runicast primitive adds two packet attributes: the single-hop
 * packet type and the single-hop packet ID.  The runicast primitive
 * uses the packet ID attribute as a sequence number for matching
 * acknowledgement packets to the corresponding data packets.
 *
 * The application or protocol that uses the runicast primitive can
 * specify the maximum number of transmissions that the ruc module
 * should attempt before the packet times out.  If a packet times out,
 * the application or protocol that sent the packet is notified with a
 * callback.
 *
 *
 * \section channels Channels
 *
 * The runicast module uses 1 channel.
