 *
 * The stubborn single-hop unicast primitive (stunicast) repeatedly
 * sends a packet to a single-hop neighbor using the unicast
 * primitive.  The stunicast primitive sends and resends the packet
 * until an upper layer primitive or protocol cancels the
 * transmission.  While it is possible for applications and protocols
 * that use Rime to use the stubborn single-hop unicast primitive
 * directly, the stunicast primitive is primarily used by the reliable
 * single-hop unicast (runicast) primitive.
 *
 * Before the stunicast primitive sends a packet, it allocates a queue
 * buffer, to which the application data and packet attributes is
 * copied, and sets a timer.  When the timer expires, the stunicast
 * primitive copies the queue buffer to the Rime buffer and sends the
 * packet using the unicast primitive.  The stunicast primitive sets the
 * number of retransmissions for a packet as a packet attribute on 
 * outgoing packets.
 *
 * \section stunicast-channels Channels
 *
 * The stunicast module uses 1 channel.
