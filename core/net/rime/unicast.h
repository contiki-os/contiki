 *
 * The unicast module sends a packet to an identified single-hop
 * neighbor.  The unicast primitive uses the broadcast primitive and
 * adds the single-hop receiver address attribute to the outgoing
 * packets. For incoming packets, the unicast module inspects the
 * single-hop receiver address attribute and discards the packet if
 * the address does not match the address of the node.
 *
 * \section channels Channels
 *
 * The unicast module uses 1 channel.
