 *
 * The broadcast module sends packets to all local area neighbors with an a
 * header that identifies the sender.
 *
 * The broadcast module sends a packet to all local neighbors.  The
 * module adds the single-hop sender address as a packet attribute to
 * outgoing packets.  All Rime primitives that need the identity of
 * the sender in the outgoing packets use the broadcast primitive,
 * either directly or indirectly through any of the other
 * communication primitives that are based on the broadcast primitive.
 *
 * \section channels Channels
 *
 * The broadcast module uses 1 channel.
