/**
 * \defgroup llsec Link Layer Security
 * 
 * Layer for implementing link layer security.
 *         
 * NETSTACK_LLSEC sits in between NETSTACK_MAC and NETSTACK_NETWORK
 * protocols. All NETSTACK_MAC protocols invoke NETSTACK_LLSEC.input()
 * for incoming packets. Likewise, all NETSTACK_NETWORK protocols
 * invoke NETSTACK_LLSEC.send(...) for outgoing packets.
 * 
 * The bootstrap function of llsec_drivers can be used to defer the start
 * of upper layers so as to bootstrap pairwise keys. Only contiki-sky-main.c
 * supports this at the moment.
