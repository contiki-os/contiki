/**
 * \file
 *         Header file for IPv6 multicast according to the algorithm in the
 *         "MCAST Forwarding Using Trickle" internet draft.
 *
 *         The current version of the draft can always be found in
 *         http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-roll-trickle-mcast
 *
 *         This implementation is based on the draft version stored in
 *         ROLL_TM_VER.
 *
 *         In draft v2, the document was renamed to
 *         "Multicast Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (MPL)"
 *         Due to very significant changes between draft versions 1 and 2,
 *         MPL will be implemented as a separate engine and this file here
 *         will provide legacy support for Draft v1.

/*
 * The draft does not currently specify a default number for the trickle
 * interval nor a way to derive it. Examples however hint at 100 msec.
 *
 * In draft terminology, we use an 'aggressive' policy (M=0) and a conservative
 * one (M=1).
 *
 * When experimenting with the two policies on the sky platform,
 * an interval of 125ms proves to be way too low: When we have traffic,
 * doublings happen after the interval end and periodics fire after point T
 * within the interval (and sometimes even after interval end). When traffic
 * settles down, the code compensates the offsets.
 *
 * We consider 125, 250ms etc because they are nice divisors of 1 sec
 * (quotient is power of two). For some machines (e.g sky/msp430,
 * sensinode/cc243x), this is also a nice number of clock ticks
 *
 * After experimentation, the values of Imin leading to best performance are:
 * ContikiMAC: Imin=64 (500ms)
 *   Null RDC: imin=16 (125ms)
