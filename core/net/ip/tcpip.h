 *
 * TCP/IP support in Contiki is implemented using the uIP TCP/IP
 * stack. For sending and receiving data, Contiki uses the functions
 * provided by the uIP module, but Contiki adds a set of functions for
 * connection management. The connection management functions make
 * sure that the uIP TCP/IP connections are connected to the correct
 * process.
 *
 * Contiki also includes an optional protosocket library that provides
 * an API similar to the BSD socket API.
