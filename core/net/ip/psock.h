/**
 * \defgroup psock Protosockets library
 * @{
 *
 * The protosocket library provides an interface to the uIP stack that is
 * similar to the traditional BSD socket interface. Unlike programs
 * written for the ordinary uIP event-driven interface, programs
 * written with the protosocket library are executed in a sequential
 * fashion and does not have to be implemented as explicit state
 * machines.
 *
 * Protosockets only work with TCP connections.
 *
 * The protosocket library uses \ref pt protothreads to provide
 * sequential control flow. This makes the protosockets lightweight in
 * terms of memory, but also means that protosockets inherits the
 * functional limitations of protothreads. Each protosocket lives only
 * within a single function block. Automatic variables (stack
 * variables) are not necessarily retained across a protosocket
 * library function call.
 *
 * \note Because the protosocket library uses protothreads, local variables
 * will not always be saved across a call to a protosocket library
 * function. It is therefore advised that local variables are used
 * with extreme care.
 *
 * The protosocket library provides functions for sending data without
 * having to deal with retransmissions and acknowledgements, as well
 * as functions for reading data without having to deal with data
 * being split across more than one TCP segment.
 *
 * Because each protosocket runs as a protothread, the protosocket has to be
 * started with a call to PSOCK_BEGIN() at the start of the function
 * in which the protosocket is used. Similarly, the protosocket protothread can
 * be terminated by a call to PSOCK_EXIT().
