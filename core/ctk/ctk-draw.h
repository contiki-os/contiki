 * The CTK device driver functions are divided into two modules, the
 * ctk-draw module and the ctk-arch module. The purpose of the
 * ctk-arch and the ctk-draw modules is to act as an interface between
 * the CTK and the actual hardware of the system on which Contiki is
 * run. The ctk-arch takes care of the keyboard input from the user,
 * and the ctk-draw is responsible for drawing the CTK desktop,
 * windows and user interface widgets onto the actual screen.

/**
 * \page ctk-draw The ctk-draw module
 *
 * In order to work efficiently even on limited systems, CTK uses a
 * simple coordinate system, where the screen is addressed using
 * character coordinates instead of pixel coordinates. This makes it
 * trivial to implement the coordinate system on a text-based screen,
 * and significantly reduces complexity for pixel based screen
 * systems.
 *
 * The top left of the screen is (0,0) with x and y coordinates
 * growing downwards and to the right.
 *
 * It is the responsibility of the ctk-draw module to keep track of
 * the screen size and must implement the two functions
 * ctk_draw_width() and ctk_draw_height(), which are used by the CTK
 * for querying the screen size. The functions must return the width
 * and the height of the ctk-draw screen in character coordinates.
 *
 * The ctk-draw module is responsible for drawing CTK windows onto the
 * screen through the function ctk_draw_window().. A pseudo-code
 * implementation of this  function might look like this:
 * \code
   ctk_draw_window(window, focus, clipy1, clipy2, draw_borders) {
      if(draw_borders) {
         draw_window_borders(window, focus, clipy1, clipy2);
      }
      foreach(widget, window->inactive) {
         ctk_draw_widget(widget, focus, clipy1, clipy2);
      }
      foreach(widget, window->active) {
         if(widget == window->focused) {
	    ctk_draw_widget(widget, focus | CTK_FOCUS_WIDGET,
	                    clipy1, clipy2);
	 } else {
	    ctk_draw_widget(widget, focus, clipy1, clipy2);
	 }
      }
   }
   
   \endcode
 *
 * Where draw_window_borders() draws the window borders (also between
 * clipy1 and clipy2). The ctk_draw_widget() function is explained
 * below. Notice how the clipy1 and clipy2 parameters are passed to
 * all other functions; every function needs to know the boundaries
 * within which they are allowed to draw.
 *
 * In order to aid in implementing a ctk-draw module, a text-based
 * ctk-draw called ctk-conio has already been implemented. It conforms
 * to the Borland conio C library, and a skeleton implementation of
 * said library exists in lib/libconio.c. If a more machine specific
 * ctk-draw module is to be implemented, the instructions in this file
 * should be followed.

   #define CTK_FOCUS_WINDOW   2
   #define CTK_FOCUS_DIALOG   4
