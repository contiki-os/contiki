/**
 * \defgroup elfloaderarch Architecture specific functionality for the ELF loader.
 *
 * The architecture specific functionality for the Contiki ELF loader
 * has to be implemented for each processor type Contiki runs on.
 *
 * Since the ELF format is slightly different for different processor
 * types, the Contiki ELF loader is divided into two parts: the
 * generic ELF loader module (\ref elfloader) and the architecture
 * specific part (this module). The architecture specific part deals
 * with memory allocation, code and data relocation, and writing the
 * relocated ELF code into program memory.
 *
 * To port the Contiki ELF loader to a new processor type, this module
 * has to be implemented for the new processor type.
