/**
 * \defgroup mt Multi-threading library
 *
 * The event driven Contiki kernel does not provide multi-threading
 * by itself - instead, preemptive multi-threading is implemented
 * as a library that optionally can be linked with applications. This
 * library consists of two parts: a platform independent part, which is
 * the same for all platforms on which Contiki runs, and a platform
 * specific part, which must be implemented specifically for the
 * platform that the multi-threading library should run.
 *
 * @{

/**
 * \defgroup mtarch Architecture support for multi-threading
 * @{
 *
 * The Contiki multi-threading library requires some architecture
 * specific support for setting up and switching stacks. This support
 * requires four stack manipulation functions to be implemented:
 * mtarch_start(), which sets up the stack frame for a new thread,
 * mtarch_exec(), which switches in the stack of a thread,
 * mtarch_yield(), which restores the kernel stack from a thread's
 * stack and mtarch_stop(), which cleans up the stack of a thread.
 * Additionally, two functions for controlling the preemption
 * (if any) must be implemented: mtarch_pstart() and mtarch_pstop().
 * If no preemption is used, these functions can be implemented as
 * empty functions. Finally, the function mtarch_init() is called by
 * mt_init(), and can be used for initialization of timer interrupts,
 * or any other mechanisms required for correct operation of the
 * architecture specific support functions while mtarch_remove() is
 * called by mt_remove() to clean up those resources.
