/**
 * \file
 * Implementation of local continuations based on the "Labels as
 * values" feature of gcc
 * \author
 * Adam Dunkels <adam@sics.se>
 *
 * This implementation of local continuations is based on a special
 * feature of the GCC C compiler called "labels as values". This
 * feature allows assigning pointers with the address of the code
 * corresponding to a particular C label.
 *
 * For more information, see the GCC documentation:
 * http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Labels-as-Values.html
 *
 * Thanks to dividuum for finding the nice local scope label
 * implementation.
