/**
 * \defgroup stimer Seconds timer library
 *
 * The stimer library provides functions for setting, resetting and
 * restarting timers, and for checking if a timer has expired. An
 * application must "manually" check if its timers have expired; this
 * is not done automatically.
 *
 * A timer is declared as a \c struct \c stimer and all access to the
 * timer is made by a pointer to the declared timer.
 *
 * \note The stimer library is not able to post events when a timer
 * expires. The \ref etimer "Event timers" should be used for this
 * purpose.
 *
 * \note The stimer library uses the \ref clock "Clock library" to
 * measure time. Intervals should be specified in the seconds.
 *
 * \sa \ref etimer "Event timers"
