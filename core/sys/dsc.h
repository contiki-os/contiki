/**
 * \page dsc The program description structure
 *
 * The Contiki DSC structure is used for describing programs. It
 * includes a string describing the program, the name of the program
 * file on disk (or a pointer to the programs initialization function
 * for systems without disk support), a bitmap icon and a text version
 * of the same icon.
 *
 * The DSC is saved into a file which can be loaded by programs such
 * as the "Directory" application which reads all DSC files on disk
 * and presents the icons and descriptions in a window.
