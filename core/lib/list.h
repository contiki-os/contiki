/**
 * \defgroup list Linked list library
 *
 * The linked list library provides a set of functions for
 * manipulating linked lists.
 *
 * A linked list is made up of elements where the first element \b
 * must be a pointer. This pointer is used by the linked list library
 * to form lists of the elements.
 *
 * Lists are declared with the LIST() macro. The declaration specifies
 * the name of the list that later is used with all list functions.
 *
 * Lists can be manipulated by inserting or removing elements from
 * either sides of the list (list_push(), list_add(), list_pop(),
 * list_chop()). A specified element can also be removed from inside a
 * list with list_remove(). The head and tail of a list can be
 * extracted using list_head() and list_tail(), respectively.
