/**

\mainpage ECC Library for Contiki

This package provides the Contiki port of TinyECC software package.All elliptic 
curve operations, including point addition, point doubling and scalar point 
multiplication are ported. Currently, in addition to the basic elliptic curve 
operations, ECDSA operations (signature generation and verification) are also 
ported. For the testing purpose, only SECP160R1 is used as the Elliptic Curve 
Domain Parameters. This has been tested on Cooja for ECDSA operations. 
A key agreement mechanism like Diffieâ€“Hellman has to be implemented. 
Currently, all natural number operations are performed in a generic way. 
But most of these natural number operations can be optimized by using 
microprocessor specific assembly instructions.
