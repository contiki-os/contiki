/**
 * \defgroup trickle-timer Trickle timers
 *
 * This library implements timers which behave in accordance with RFC 6206
 * "The Trickle Algorithm" (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6206)
 *
 * Protocols wishing to use trickle timers, may use this library instead of
 * implementing the trickle algorithm internally.
 *
 * The protocol implementation will declare one (or more) variable(s) of type
 * struct ::trickle_timer and will then populate its fields by calling
 * trickle_timer_config(). trickle_timer_set() will start the timer.
 *
 * When the timer reaches time t within the current trickle interval, the
 * library will call a protocol-provided callback, which will signal to the
 * protocol that it is time to TX (see algorithm step 4 in the RFC).
 *
 * The proto does not need to check the suppression conditions. This is done by
 * the library and if TX must be suppressed, the callback won't be called at
 * all.
 *
 * The library also provides functions to be called when the protocol hears a
 * 'consistent' or 'inconsistent' message and when an 'external event' occurs
 * (in this context, those terms have the exact same meaning as in the RFC).
