/**
 * \defgroup coding-style Coding style
 *
 * This is how a Doxygen module is documented - start with a \defgroup
 * Doxygen keyword at the beginning of the file to define a module,
 * and use the \addtogroup Doxygen keyword in all other files that
 * belong to the same module. Typically, the \defgroup is placed in
 * the .h file and \addtogroup in the .c file.
 *
 * The Contiki source code contains a GNU Indent script that can
 * automatically format a C code file to match the Contiki code
 * style. The Indent configuration is in contiki/tools/indent.pro and
 * a small helper script is in contiki/tools/contiki-indent. Note that
 * this is not a silver bullet - for example, the script does not add
 * separators between functions, nor does it format comments
 * correctly. The script should be treated as an aid in formatting
 * code: first run the formatter on the source code, then manually
 * edit the file.
