/**
 * \defgroup servreghack A service registration and diseemination hack
 * @{
 *
 * This application is a quick'n'dirty hack for registering,
 * disseminating, and looking up services. A service is identified by
 * an 8-bit integer between 1 and 255. Integers below 128 are reserved
 * for system services.
 *
 * A service is registered with the function
 * servreg_hack_register(). Registered services will be transmitted to
 * all neighbors that run the servreg-hack application. These will in
 * turn resend the registration to their neighbors.
 *
 * Services from neighbors are stored in a local table. Services
 * stored in the table can be looked up using a combination of the
 * servreg_hack_list() and servreg_hack_item_match() functions.
