 * \defgroup mqtt-engine An implementation of MQTT v3.1
 * @{
 *
 * This application is an engine for MQTT v3.1. It supports QoS Levels 0 and 1.
 *
 * MQTT is a Client Server publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol.
 * It is light weight, open, simple, and designed so as to be easy to implement.
 * These characteristics make it ideal for use in many situations, including
 * constrained environments such as for communication in Machine to Machine
 * (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) contexts where a small code footprint is
 * required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.
 *
 * The protocol runs over TCP/IP, more specifically tcp_socket.
 * Its features include:
 *
 * - Use of the publish/subscribe message pattern which provides
 * one-to-many message distribution and decoupling of applications.
 * - A messaging transport that is agnostic to the content of the payload.
 * Three qualities of service for message delivery:
 * -- "At most once" (0), where messages are delivered according to the best
 *  efforts of the operating environment. Message loss can occur.
 *  This level could be used, for example, with ambient sensor data where it
 *  does not matter if an individual reading is lost as the next one will be
 *  published soon after.
 *  --"At least once" (1), where messages are assured to arrive but duplicates
 *  can occur.
 *  -- "Exactly once" (2), where message are assured to arrive exactly once.
 *  This level could be used, for example, with billing systems where duplicate
 *  or lost messages could lead to incorrect charges being applied. This QoS
 *  level is currently not supported in this implementation.
 *
 * - A small transport overhead and protocol exchanges minimized to reduce
 *   network traffic.
 * - A mechanism, Last Will, to notify interested parties when an abnormal
 *   disconnection occurs.
 *
 *   The protocol specification and other useful information can be found
 *   here: http://mqtt.org
