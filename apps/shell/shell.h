/**
 * \defgroup shell The Contiki shell
 * @{
 *
 * The Contiki shell provides both interactive and batch processing
 * for Contiki.
 *
 * The shell consists of two parts: the shell application and a shell
 * back-end. The shell application contains all the logic of the
 * shell, whereas the shell back-end provides I/O for the
 * shell. Examples of shell back-ends are a serial I/O shell back-end,
 * that allows the shell to operate over a serial connection, and a
 * telnet server back-end, that allows the shell to operate over a
 * TCP/IP telnet connection.
