Circular Motion
================

This folder contains a demo of how dynamic mobility can be implemented in contiki-cooja setup.

There are 2 global variables in the contiki code: pos_x and pos_y. These two variables are updated in accordance with the equation of a circle. 
Cooja reads these variables to update the position of the motes in GUI.

For more information, please checkout tools/cooja/Readme_Mobility.md
