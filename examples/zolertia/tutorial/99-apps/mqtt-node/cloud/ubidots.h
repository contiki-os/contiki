/* We are using the device Client ID to publish to a topic as:
 * /v1.6/devices/{CLIENT_ID}
 * That it why the DEFAULT_PUB_STRING is not used and removed
 *
 * Subscription topic is:
 * /v1.6/devices/{CLIENT_ID}/#
 * Thus why the DEFAULT_CMD_STRING was removed...
 *
 * The expected Ubidots subscription topic is:
 * /v1.6/devices/{LABEL_DATA_SOURCE}/{LABEL_VARIABLE}
 * As currently Ubidots doesn't support multilevel "#" wildcards, it is not
 * possible to subscribe to a topic, as currently done in other platforms, so we
 * need to choose a variable.  As default we are mapping the leds_toggle, change
 * to other value as required.  The topic would be then:
 * /v1.6/devices/{CLIENT_ID}/leds_toggle/lv
 *
 * We use "/lv" to retrieve the value only, if you need the full JSON response
 * it would be something like:
 * {"timestamp": 1475154149778, "context": {}, "value": 1.0,
 *  "id": "57ed10e576254270bd7fc455"}

 * The following default commands are available only if using the
