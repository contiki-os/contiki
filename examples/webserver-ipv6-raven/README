This example features a simple webserver running on top of the IPv6
contiki stack. It differs from the generic webserver6 example in that
wherever possible data is stored in avr flash memory instead of RAM.
In addition are cgi scripts for displaying temperature and voltage sensors,
and sleep and radio statistics, on web pages.

A bare $make will use the avr-raven platform. Alternate compatible platforms can
be specified, e.g. $make TARGET=avr-atmega128rfa1. In that case the webserver
process and web content located in that platform directory will be used.

The perl script /tools/makefsdata converts web content from (by default)
all the files in the /httpd-fs subdirectory into the c source file /httpd-fsdata.c.
This file is not deleted in a $make clean so that a rebuild can be done without
perl in the toolchain (e.g. from a Windows cmd window). If any web file is
changed the dependencies will attempt to update httpd-fsdata.c. If perl
is not present, touching httpd-fsdata.c will give it a newer modification date
and allow the build to continue.
  
Two alternate web contents Huginn and Muninn are included in this directory.
Use e.g. $make WEBDIR=Huginn to generate a webserver6-huginn.elf file.
Different ipv6 address suffix and server names can be specified in the makefsdata.h
file of each directory so that mote addresses will not conflict.

webserver6.elf is always generated. It is also copied to another file whose name
indicates the platform and web directory. $make clean operates only the specified
target and webdir.  For example:

$make
 (builds webserver6.elf and webserver6-avr-raven.elf)
$make WEBDIR=huginn
 (builds webserver6.elf and webserver6-huginn-avr-raven.elf)
$make WEBDIR=muninn TARGET=avr-atmega128rfa1
 (builds webserver6.elf and webserver6-muninn-avr-atmega128rfa1.elf)
$make clean WEBDIR=huginn TARGET=avr-atmega128rfa1
 deletes the avr-atmega128rfa1 objects and webserver6-huginn-avr-atmega128rfa1.elf
$make clean
 deletes the avr-raven objects and webserver6-avr-raven.elf
 
$make WEBDIR=xxx always forces regeneration of web content into httpd-fsdata.c and
so requires PERL. A bare $make after that will not regenerate httpd-fsdata.c.
Use $make WEBDIR=default to switch back to the default /http-fs/ content.

See Makefile.webserver for optional switches for RPL or a coffee file system.
$make UIP_CONF_RPL=1 for a RPL node, or if rpl has become the contiki default,
$make UIP_CONF_RPL=0 to override

Much headbanging can result if you do not $make clean when changing make options,
as the normal build dependencies are bypassed and the needed object modules
may not be rebuilt.

$make connect will invoke the /tools/serial-log.pl perl script to connect to
your serial debug port. This will log to the console and optional log file,
adding useful time stamps. Edit the makefile for your serial port configuration.
